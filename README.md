# Thermal Infrared Camera for Propulsion Testing and Analysis

This project's objective is to support the SDSU Rocket Project team and their mission.

Primary Use: Recording thermal videos of SDSU Rocket Project Static Hot Fire Tests in order to determine temperature anomalies and make pretty pictures. 

Secondary Use: To serve as an educational/outreach project for current SDSU Rocket Project engineers and future engineers/scientists.

This repository will build off a lot of the work completed in this forked repository of purethermal1-uvc-capture, https://github.com/Kheirlb/purethermal1-uvc-capture 

All software derives from initial work performed by GroupGets and the helpful contributions from the Lepton Maker Community. 

## Capabilities to Consider:
- Power (Portable Power Pack, Non-Portable, UPS)
- Display (Physical, Computer VNC, Both)
- Control (Analog, Digital, Both, Computer, Phone, Joystick, Buttons, Controller)
- Connection (Wireless Wifi Network, Bluetooth, VNC, Router, Ethernet, Main Bunker Control or Not)
- Durability (Drop Strength, Rocket Engine Heat/Vibration, Children, Freshmen)
- Reliability (Code Segmentation Faults, Bugs, Crashing)
- Setup Time (Feeds into the above 5)
- Security (Multiple Viewing but One Controller, Password)
- Media (Broadcasting to Internet, Broadcasting to All Bunkers)
- Uses (Hot Fire, Pan/Tilt, Recording, Overlay, Outreach)
