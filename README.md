Thermal Infrared Camera for Propulsion Testing and Analysis

This project's objective is to support the SDSU Rocket Project team and their mission.

Primary Use: Recording thermal videos of SDSU Rocket Project Static Hot Fire Tests in order to determine temperature anomalies and make pretty pictures. 

Secondary Use: To serve as an educational/outreach project for current SDSU Rocket Project engineers and future engineers/scientists.

This repository will build off a lot of the work completed in this forked repository of purethermal1-uvc-capture, https://github.com/Kheirlb/purethermal1-uvc-capture 

All software derives from initial work performed by GroupGets and the helpful contributions from the Lepton Maker Community.
